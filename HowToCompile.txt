You will need the following:
StarCraft with the Broodwars Expansion
patch the game to Version 1.16.1
Visual Studio 2010 (Express) for C# and C++
BWAPI 3.7.4



Setup the Environment:
Install the game and patch to version 1.16.1
(the patch needs to be run as administrator otherwise it won't install)

download and unpack/install BWAPI
use a location where you normally store projects, lets assume C:\Users\[User]\Documents\Projects\BWAPI

install C:\Users\[User]\Documents\Projects\BWAPI\vcredist_x86 as well 
otherwise you could run into an issue where the game will tell you you are missing a library

copy the four files (mpfr-vc90-mt-gd.dll,mpfr-vc90-mt.dll,gmp-vc90-mt-gd.dll,gmp-vc90-mt.dll) 
from the BWAPI WINDOWS into two of your Windows installation folders (system32,SysWOW64)

To Compile the Bot you will require BWAPI-MonoBridge.

Either dowload the BWAPI Bridge as an archive and extract in the bwapi folder into the bridge 
folder or git clone from "https://github.com/suegy/bwapi-mono-bridge2.git" into the same folder

navigate to the following and run:

"bwapi-mono-bridge2-master\Source\bwapi-clr-client\bwapi-clr-client.sln"

Make sure to run this in VS 2010

VS will complain that some projects werent loaded correctly, this is fine.

In the "Solution Explorer" Select "POSH-Launcher"
Then in project "Properties" change the "Project Folder" and navigate to the following in the
Bot folder "HellBot\Source\scbot.git\POSH-Launcher" and select "POSH-Launcher.csproj"
Then Right clikc "POSH-Launcher" in the "Solution Explorer" and select Reload

In the "Solution Explorer" Select "POSH-StarCraftBot"
Then in project "Properties" change the "Project Folder" and navigate to the following in the
Bot folder "HellBot\Source\scbot.git\POSH-StarCraftBot" and select "POSH-StarCraftBot.csproj"
Then Right clikc "POSH-StarCraftBot" in the "Solution Explorer" and select Reload

Once these two are loaded in simply right click on "POSH-StarCraftBot" in the "Solution Explorer"
and Rebuild. Then do the same for "POSH-Launcher" this will rebuild the bot and its libraries.

The "AI\Bot" folder in the HellBot file contains these rebuilt libraries that can be found in the following:
"HellBot\Source\scbot.git\POSH-Launcher\bin\Release"

The only additional file in the "AI\Bot" file is the dummy HellBot.dll
